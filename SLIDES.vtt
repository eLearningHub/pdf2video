Hello! My name is Matthew. I have just joined the company as the chief learning officer. I am very excited to work with you.

00:08.502 --> 00:12.200
I have a secret to share with you. I am not a real person.

00:13.212 --> 00:17.630
Now that we got that out of the way, I am going to help you share your knowledge with your coworkers.

00:18.654 --> 00:21.520
Today, we will be talking about Markdown.

00:21.719 --> 00:27.220
The slides that you see here have been generated using a tool called pandoc from text files in the markdown format.

00:28.257 --> 00:33.205
It is amazing isn't it? You can manage your slides similar to how you manage your code.

00:34.242 --> 00:40.640
I am sure you have seen GitHub readme files. That is markdown.

00:40.839 --> 00:44.427
Pandoc is a great command line tool for working with markdown files.

00:45.439 --> 00:52.257
You can publish markdown files in more than 10 output formats including PDF, HTML, PowerPoint and Word.

00:53.269 --> 00:58.800
In one of my previous jobs, I would write my reports in LaTeX and create my slides in PowerPoint.

00:59.837 --> 01:03.430
Including LaTeX math formulas in PowerPoint was a big headache.

01:04.542 --> 01:14.360
Later, when I switched to Markdown. I would write the content in Markdown and then publish all the reports and slides that I wanted in a very coherent form.

01:14.559 --> 01:17.072
The best part is that you can write LaTeX in markdown.

01:18.172 --> 01:21.065
You can get the best quality of the most simple format.

01:22.152 --> 01:25.082
I hope you are now interested to know more about Markdown.

01:26.169 --> 01:33.600
Please do your own research but take a look at aar studio. It is one of the best things that has happened to markdown. You will like it!
